- 👀 I’m interested in music, self-development, dogs, science documentaries, the Discovery Channel 😄, quality time with family and friends ❤️, and of course video games (FIFA over PES 😌).
- 💼 My skills include critical thinking, web development (MERN Stack), public speaking, and a little sense of humour (if only dogs can laugh).
- 🌱 Studying at AltSchool (SOE - Tinyuka Session).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on innovative ideas and technologies.
