- 👋🏽 Hi, I’m Douglas. 🐶👓
- 👀 I’m interested in music, self development, dogs, science documetaries, discovery channel 😄, quality time with family and friends ❤️, and of course video games (FIFA over PES 😌).
- 💼 My skills include mobile app development (Flutter), UI design (Figma), public speaking, a little sense of humor (if only dogs can laugh).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Full-stack Web Development is the goal. ⚽🥅
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on innovative ideas and technologies.
- 📫 Reach me on Linkedin - (https://www.linkedin.com/in/id-douglas/) || Instagram - (https://www.instagram.com/lazydoug/)
- 📢 “…if you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.” Let’s go together!
